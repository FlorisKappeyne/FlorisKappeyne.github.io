<h2 id="the-project">The project</h2>

<p>Arboreal is an open-world farming and adventuring game where you save ancient colossi from a spreading corruption. This game was my 3rd year project at the NHTV Breda. Its production started in September 2017 and continued until the end of that school year (July 2018). It is the longest project I&rsquo;ve worked on so far, and it also was the biggest team: we started with 30 people, but this steadily grew into 35 over the year. I was in two management positions, and worked on the Combat and AI of the game.</p>

<p>The game is currently in closed-beta, and will be released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/881300/Arboreal/">Steam</a> the 10th of July. Our game was shown on <a href="https://www.dutchgamegarden.nl/project/arboreal/">Indigo</a> the 29th of June.</p>

<p>The goal of this project was to learn how development felt in a big team over a long time, and I think it succeeded. We went through every single phase of development, had our ups and downs, and delivered a game I am proud of in the end.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>

<ul>
<li>AI/Gameplay programmer (focussed on combat gameplay)</li>
<li>Optimization programmer</li>
<li>Tech Lead for 8 weeks</li>
<li>Scrum Master for 5 weeks<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of the year I had a lot of jobs. I oversaw production as Scrum Master and worked on prototypes (block A), I was the Tech Lead and worked on designing and implementing the first version of combat (block B), I was a full time Gameplay Programmer working with designer and iterating constantly on combat (block C and end of block D) and I was tasked with optimizing the game, because it was far too slow (beginning of block D).</p>

<p>I had many different roles in this project. The third year of my study is meant to experience all phases of development and show that you can deliver a finished product, and I wanted to make use of this by using the phases that I was familiar with to experiment with different roles. Therefore, I learned lessons both in the neighbourhood of production and soft skills, and technical skills during this project.</p>

<p>Also during this project, I worked on both my <a href="https://floriskappeyne.github.io/post/path-tracer/">path tracer</a> and this portfolio.</p>
