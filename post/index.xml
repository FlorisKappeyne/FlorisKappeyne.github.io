      <description>This video cannot be played.  The project Arboreal is an open-world farming and adventuring game where you save ancient colossi from a spreading corruption. This game was my 3rd year project at the NHTV Breda. Its production started in September 2017 and continued until the end of that school year (July 2018). It is the longest project I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on so far, and it also was the biggest team: we started with 30 people, but this grew into 35 over the year.</description>

      <description>This video cannot be played.  The project I started with my path tracer somewhere in March 2017 and still continue to work on it. At the start of the program, I made a basic ray tracer. A few weeks later I borrowed a book from the library (PBRT, click here to learn more) which made me increase my goal to make a full blown physically based renderer. I followed the basic structure of PBRT for a long time but ultimately I added so many changes of my own that it&amp;rsquo;s not really recognizable anymore.</description>

      <description>This video cannot be played.  The project AGR: The Fastest Drifter is an Anti-Gravity Racing game, made with the custom cross-platform (Windows and PS4) Voodoo Rewind Racing Engine. Created by a team of 6 programmers at first (the first block of 8 weeks), and 19 people (7 programmers, 12 designers and artists) at the end, it is one of the biggest projects I have worked on so far. In the end, it featured a fully functioning racing game for both single player and local multiplayer, audio, particle effects, several post processing effects on top of the physically based rendering, a complete game-flow with UI and intro cinematics and a suite of tools usable by designers to tweak the game while playing it.</description>

      <description>This video cannot be played.  The project Clouded is a VR game where the player controls the clouds. By influencing the wind in the sky, he guides clouds into forming rain or even storm clouds which influence a simulation on the ground below. The simulation is run on a hexagon grid, and each tile ranges from dry to wet (Desert, Savannah, Grass, Swamp, Water). On Grass, cities and forests spawn, which grow over time.</description>

      <description>This video cannot be played.  The project Kick the Pig is a physics based game where you put a dirty pig into a bath tub by kicking him into the air and guide his trajectory using magnets and repulsors until the pig is finally clean. All physics in this game are custom made.

      <description>Sorry for the awful sound, this was the only footage I could find of the game. The scratching noises are the bowling balls rolling over their bearings. This video cannot be played. 
The project Orbis was the first of the three games I made in block B, year 2 of IGAD. The game was made in two weeks. The only constraint we had was that we had to use a custom controller.</description>
